# SAFE TFA Matrix

The **TFA (Technology-Facilitated Abuse) Matrix** is a structured framework for understanding and categorising tactics and techniques used in technology-facilitated interpersonal harm.

Developed by [Not A Standard](https://notastandard.org), the TFA Matrix applies threat intelligence methodologies — originally designed for cybersecurity — to map patterns of technology-enabled abuse, coercive control, and harassment.
