TFA-T-3011 Contact Bombing Signing victim up for large volumes of spam, unwanted subscriptions, mailing lists, or services to overwhelm their communications and cause distress. May also include signing victim up for politically sensitive, embarrassing, or compromising services. TFA-T-4006 Context Manipulation Sharing genuine content \u2014 real messages, photos, videos, or statements \u2014 stripped of essential context to create a misleading impression of victim's character, actions, or intentions. Includes selective quoting, cropping images, sharing old content as if current, or presenting content without the circumstances that explain it. TFA-T-3004 Coordinated Harassment Campaign Organizing or inciting multiple people to simultaneously harass victim through pile-ons, brigading, coordinated reporting, mass messaging, or targeted online mob behavior. Perpetrator may directly recruit participants or create conditions that provoke organic harassment from communities. TFA-T-2001 Credential Theft Obtaining victim's passwords, PINs, or authentication credentials through shoulder surfing, guessing based on personal knowledge, social engineering, checking common password patterns, or accessing written password records. Intimate partners often have enough personal knowledge to guess passwords or know where credentials are stored. TFA-T-6008 Credit/Identity Theft Opening financial accounts, taking on debt, applying for credit, or conducting financial transactions using victim's personal information and identity without consent. Damages victim's credit score, creates legal liability, and may take years to resolve. Often not discovered until victim is denied credit or contacted by collectors. TFA-T-6006 Crypto/Investment Fraud Deceiving victim into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments, fake trading platforms, or other financial schemes. Often involves building trust, demonstrating fake returns, and gradually escalating investment amounts. May also involve coerced cryptocurrency transfers that are difficult to trace or recover. TFA-T-4004 Deepfake Creation Creating synthetic intimate, compromising, or damaging media of victim using AI-powered deepfake technology. Generated content may be indistinguishable from real imagery and can be used for extortion, reputational harm, or psychological abuse.

Includes moving or deleting files, editing shared documents, changing device settings, manipulating photo timestamps, or altering digital records the victim relies on. TFA-T-3001 Direct Threat Messaging Sending threatening messages to victim via any digital platform, including text messages, emails, direct messages, voice messages, or comments. Threats may be explicit (threatening violence, harm, or consequences) or implicit (veiled references to harm, ominous statements, or threatening imagery). TFA-T-3005 Doxxing Publishing victim's private information (home address, phone number, workplace, family members, daily routines) publicly or to targeted audiences with intent to enable harassment, stalking, or physical harm. Doxxing weaponizes personal information by removing the victim's control over who has access to it, often resulting in coordinated harassment, threats, and real-world danger. TFA-T-5010 Email/Communication Rerouting Setting up email forwarding rules, message redirects, or call forwarding to intercept victim's incoming communications without their knowledge. Allows perpetrator to monitor all communications and selectively prevent messages from reaching victim, particularly from support services or legal representatives. TFA-T-7009 Emergency Service Manipulation Filing false police reports, fabricating evidence for protective orders, making false welfare check requests, or otherwise weaponizing emergency and legal services against victim. Uses digital tools to create false evidence, coordinate false reports, or manipulate authorities into taking action against victim. TFA-T-6010 Employment Sabotage Interfering with victim's employment through manipulation of work communications, sending messages to employers, sabotaging job applications, damaging professional online presence, or disrupting work-related accounts. Aims to undermine victim's economic independence and professional reputation. TFA-T-4011 Fake Evidence Creation Fabricating digital evidence including fake emails, text messages, documents, receipts, screenshots, or records to frame victim for misconduct, support false legal claims, or manipulate decision-makers. May involve sophisticated forgeries using editing tools or simple fabrication of documents. TFA-T-4005 False Narrative Campaigns Systematically spreading false information about victim to their social network, workplace, community, or online audiences. False narratives may portray victim as unstable, abusive, dishonest, or dangerous, serving to isolate victim from support, preemptively discredit their accounts of abuse, and build sympathy for perpetrator. TFA-T-6001 Financial Account Lockout Changing passwords, removing authorized users, or otherwise denying victim access to shared or individual financial accounts. Cuts victim off from their own money, savings, investments, or financial records, creating immediate economic vulnerability and dependence. TFA-T-1010 Fitness/Health Tracker Surveillance Monitoring victim through health and fitness applications, wearable trackers, period tracking apps, sleep monitors, or medical portals. These platforms often contain highly sensitive data about location, physical activity, health conditions, reproductive status, and daily routines. TFA-T-4010 Historical Content Weaponization Surfacing old posts, photos, messages, or other historical digital content to harm victim in their current context. Includes finding embarrassing teenage posts, old dating profiles, past political statements, or previously private content that can be taken out of context to damage victim's current relationships, employment, or reputation. TFA-T-5009 Identity Document Control Controlling access to digital copies of victim's important identification documents including passport scans, birth certificates, tax records, medical records, immigration documents, or legal paperwork. Restricts victim's ability to access services, prove identity, or leave the relationship. TFA-T-3009 Impersonation Harassment Creating fake accounts impersonating victim to damage their reputation, relationships, or employment. Fake accounts may send messages to victim's contacts, post inappropriate content, engage in harmful activities, or create the appearance that victim is behaving erratically or antisocially. TFA-T-7006 IoT Device Weaponization Using smart home devices to create fear, disorientation, or physical discomfort. Includes randomly triggering alarms, playing sounds through speakers, turning lights on/off, changing temperature extremes, activating cameras, or other manipulations of the smart home environment designed to terrorize victim. TFA-T-7001 Location-Based Assault Using GPS tracking, location sharing, or other surveillance techniques to determine victim's real-time location and then physically approaching or assaulting them. Technology enables perpetrator to find victim at any location, negating traditional safety measures like staying with friends or varying routines. TFA-T-7007 Medical Device Interference Tampering with victim's connected medical devices, health monitoring equipment, or health data. May include altering medication reminder settings, manipulating health data to affect treatment decisions, disabling monitoring devices, or interfering with telehealth appointments. Creates direct physical health risks. TFA-T-4001 Message/Evidence Tampering Editing, deleting, selectively screenshotting, or fabricating screenshots of conversations, messages, or digital records to misrepresent what was communicated. Used to create false evidence, destroy exculpatory evidence, or support false narratives in legal proceedings and social contexts. TFA-T-7003 Movement Interception Using location tracking data to intercept victim during travel, at appointments, or at known destinations. Perpetrator uses real-time or predicted location information to position themselves along victim's route or at their destination. Creates a sense of inescapable surveillance and control. TFA-T-5005 Network Poisoning Contacting victim's support network (friends, family, colleagues, therapist, legal counsel) to spread lies, create conflict, or undermine trust. Perpetrator strategically reaches out to key support people to isolate victim from help sources, often preemptively positioning themselves as the reasonable party. TFA-T-1007 Network Traffic Monitoring Monitoring victim's internet activity through router administrative access, DNS logs, or network monitoring tools. Perpetrator can see websites visited, search queries, app usage patterns, and connected devices. May install network-level monitoring tools or exploit existing router features. TFA-T-4003 Non-Consensual Intimate Image Distribution Sharing or threatening to share intimate, sexual, or nude images of victim without their consent. Commonly known as 'revenge porn,' this technique weaponizes intimate content to humiliate, control, or coerce victim. Includes sharing via private messages, posting publicly, uploading to pornographic websites, or sending to victim's contacts, family, or employer. TFA-T-2003 Password/Recovery Change Changing passwords and recovery options (backup email, phone number, security questions) on victim's accounts to lock them out and prevent recovery. This technique ensures persistent denial of access even if victim attempts account recovery procedures. TFA-T-3002 Persistent Unwanted Contact Repeatedly contacting victim despite clear requests to stop, across one or multiple communication platforms. Volume and persistence are used to exhaust, intimidate, and demonstrate that the victim cannot escape the perpetrator's reach. May include hundreds of messages, calls, or contact attempts per day. TFA-T-1002 Physical Tracker Planting Placing GPS tracking devices such as AirTags, Tile trackers, or vehicle GPS units in victim's belongings, vehicle, or on their person without consent. These commercially available devices are inexpensive, small, and designed for long battery life, making covert placement easy. Perpetrators use them to monitor victim's movements, identify frequented locations, and anticipate travel patterns. TFA-T-3007 Platform Abuse Reporting Weaponizing platform content moderation and reporting systems to get victim's accounts banned, restricted, or content removed. Perpetrator files false or exaggerated reports about victim's content, coordinating multiple reports to trigger automated enforcement. Silences victim and removes their online presence. TFA-T-5006 Platform Banning Coordination Orchestrating victim's removal or banning from online platforms, groups, or communities where they have established support networks. Uses coordinated mass reporting, false claims of terms of service violations, or manipulation of community moderators to silence and isolate victim. TFA-T-3012 Proxy Harassment via AI Using AI tools including large language models, voice cloning, or text generation to create and distribute harassing content at scale. AI enables perpetrators to generate personalized, varied harassment content more quickly and in greater volume than manual methods, and may disguise the perpetrator's authorship. TFA-T-3008 Public Humiliation Posts Posting embarrassing, mocking, degrading, or humiliating content about victim on public platforms. Content may include unflattering images, private information, personal struggles, or fabricated scenarios designed to damage victim's social standing and cause emotional harm. TFA-T-4009 Reputation Destruction SEO Creating websites, blog posts, social media content, or other material specifically designed to rank highly in search results for victim's name, damaging their reputation to anyone who searches for them. Content may include false accusations, embarrassing information, intimate images, or misleading narratives. TFA-T-3010 Review/Rating Attacks Posting false negative reviews of victim's business, professional profiles, or services across review platforms. Damages victim's professional reputation, income, and career prospects. May coordinate multiple fake reviews to appear credible. TFA-T-7002 Safe Location Disclosure Revealing the location of victim's shelter, safe house, refuge, or hidden address to the perpetrator or others. May involve sharing information publicly, telling mutual contacts, or using technology to discover and disclose the protected location, directly endangering victim's physical safety. TFA-T-2004 Session Hijacking Maintaining persistent access to victim's logged-in sessions by keeping devices logged in, copying session tokens, or exploiting 'remember this device' features. Allows perpetrator to monitor accounts without triggering new login alerts, making detection more difficult. TFA-T-4007 Sextortion Threatening to release intimate content (real or fabricated) unless victim complies with demands for money, further intimate content, sexual acts, or other concessions. Combines elements of sexual exploitation, financial fraud, and psychological coercion, creating a cycle of escalating demands. TFA-T-1003 Shared Account Surveillance Exploiting legitimately shared accounts or location sharing services (Find My Friends, Google location sharing, family phone plans) to monitor victim beyond the scope of original consent. Often occurs in relationships where sharing was mutual but continues after separation, or where the perpetrator coerces ongoing access under the guise of reasonable family coordination. TFA-T-2008 Shared Account Weaponization Using legitimately shared accounts for streaming services, utilities, subscriptions, or household management to exert control or punish victim. Includes changing shared passwords, cancelling shared services, monitoring usage patterns, or using account features to track victim's activity and preferences. TFA-T-6009 Smart Home Resource Control Controlling heating, cooling, electricity, water, locks, lighting, or other utilities through smart home systems to coerce, punish, or make the home environment hostile. Perpetrator with administrative access can remotely control living conditions, creating physical discomfort or danger. TFA-T-1006 Smart Home Surveillance Using shared smart home devices including cameras, video doorbells, baby monitors, voice assistants, and other IoT devices to monitor victim's presence, activities, conversations, and visitors. Often exploits devices installed during cohabitation where perpetrator retains administrative access after separation. TFA-T-7004 Smart Lock Manipulation Remotely locking victim inside or outside of their residence, changing access codes, or manipulating smart lock systems to control victim's physical movement and access to shelter. May also include granting access to others or monitoring entry/exit patterns. TFA-T-5003 Social Media Control Controlling who victim can follow, friend, interact with, or be visible to on social media platforms. May involve demanding victim unfriend specific contacts, monitoring follower/following lists, requiring approval before posting, or demanding social media passwords to vet all interactions. TFA-T-1004 Social Media Monitoring Systematic observation of victim's public and semi-public social media activity, connections, check-ins, likes, comments, and tagged posts. May include creating fake accounts to follow private profiles, monitoring friends' posts for references to victim, or using social media analytics tools to track patterns of activity and connections. TFA-T-6003 Spending Restrictions Using account controls, card limits, transaction blocks, or approval requirements to restrict what victim can spend money on, how much, and where. May exploit joint account features, parental controls on youth accounts applied to adults, or business account administrative features. TFA-T-1001 Stalkerware Installation Installing hidden monitoring software on victim's device to track location, messages, calls, photos, and keystrokes. Stalkerware (also called spouseware or creepware) is commercially available software marketed for 'parental monitoring' or 'employee tracking' but frequently used for intimate partner surveillance. These apps typically hide their presence, run silently in the background, and transmit data to the perpetrator. TFA-T-7008 Stalking Coordination Using technology to plan, coordinate, and execute physical stalking of victim. Includes using location data to track patterns, mapping victim's routine, coordinating with others to maintain surveillance, and using digital tools to avoid detection. Technology amplifies traditional stalking by providing real-time intelligence. TFA-T-6011 Subscription/Service Cancellation Cancelling victim's essential services including phone plans, internet service, insurance, utility accounts, or subscriptions without consent. Disrupts victim's daily life, communication ability, and access to essential services. May be timed to cause maximum impact such as during extreme weather or when victim is isolated. TFA-T-5008 Support Resource Blocking Blocking victim's access to helplines, support websites, crisis services, legal aid resources, or domestic violence organizations. May involve website blocking through router controls, removing helpline numbers from victim's phone, or intercepting communications with support services. TFA-T-3006 Swatting Making false emergency reports (bomb threats, hostage situations, active shooter calls) to provoke armed law enforcement response at victim's location. Swatting creates immediate physical danger to victim and household, causes severe psychological trauma, and may result in injury or death from police response. TFA-T-1009 Third-Party Monitoring Recruitment Enlisting friends, family members, mutual contacts, or acquaintances (sometimes called 'flying monkeys') to monitor and report on victim's activities, location, companions, and emotional state. May involve deliberately maintaining relationships with victim's contacts for intelligence gathering purposes. TFA-T-6002 Transaction Monitoring Tracking all of victim's financial transactions through shared bank account access, transaction alert notifications, statement monitoring, or financial app access. Creates comprehensive surveillance of victim's spending, location (from merchant addresses), social activities, and any attempts to prepare for leaving. TFA-T-2006 Two-Factor Interception Intercepting two-factor authentication codes through SIM swapping, access to victim's authenticator app, interception of SMS codes, or control of backup codes. Defeats security measures designed to protect accounts, enabling unauthorized access even when victim has changed passwords. TFA-T-6004 Unauthorized Transactions Making purchases, transfers, or withdrawals from victim's financial accounts without consent. May drain savings, make extravagant purchases, transfer funds to perpetrator-controlled accounts, or take on debt in victim's name. Often escalates during separation when perpetrator seeks to deplete shared resources. TFA-T-7005 Vehicle Sabotage Remotely disabling, manipulating, or monitoring victim's connected vehicle. Modern connected cars may be remotely controlled through manufacturer apps, including locking/unlocking, starting/stopping engine, tracking location, and in some cases controlling speed or braking.
